# Replace URL By Title
Simple Google Apps Script to replace all URLs in a document with the title of the website.

Annoyed having a lot of "https://..." URLs in your Google document, but would rather prefer to have a meaningful description of what this page is about in your text?

Simply open Apps Script from your document, copy the function `replaceURLByTitle()` into the opened `Code.gs` file and run it.
